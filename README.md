## Project Overview | CUPRA Feel

This project is our implementation of the **Know your CUPRA** challenge, presented at the HackUPC 2025 Hackathon, by the **CUPRA | Seat** company.

The project consists on a groundbreaking digital twin representation of the **Cupra Tavascan 2024** car so that the customers of the model are able to learn all its cutting-edge functionalities without reading the manual. This allows them to enjoy a full exploitation of the car features before they even get the car.

This digital twin includes many state of the art functionalities, such as a **3D model** representation of the car integrated with a user-friendly tutorial. In addition to the tutorial, voice interactive **Generative AI** agent is able to answer any user question based on the oficial car user manual using a **RAG strategy**. Moreover, we have implemented a electroencephalograpic (controlled with the mind) driving simulator for the Tavascan.
